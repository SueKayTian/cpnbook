    <h2>Project 1: CPN Modelling</h2>

    <p>The project is concerned with CPN modelling and the aim is to
    make a number of modifications and extensions to the <a href="../models/chapter2/2-10NondeterministicProtocol.cpn">CPN model</a> of the
    simple protocol described in Chapter 2.</p>

    <h4>Task 1: Packet Generation</h4>

    <p>The initial marking of the place PacketToSend specifies six
    packets that are to be transmitted by the protocol.  When
    modelling the sliding window protocols in task 2 and 3, more
    packets will be required to explore the models.</p>

    <p> Modify the CPN model of the simple protocol such that there is
    a transition that adds a packet to PacketToSend whenever it
    occurs. The i'th packet should be given sequence number <i>i</i>
    and the data content
    <i>"i "</i>. The latter makes it easy to check that the packets
    are delivered in the correct order by the receiver.</p>

    <h4>Task 2: Go-Back-N Window Protocol</h4>

    <p>The simple protocol is a stop-and-wait protocol: The sender
    keeps sending the same packet until the matching acknowledgement
    is received. In <i>sliding window protocols</i>, it is possible
    for the sender to transmit several packets to the receiver before
    receiving an acknowledgement, i.e., the sender has a <i>sender
    window</i> containing <i>w</i> data packets which is currently
    under transmission and for which acknowledgement have not yet been
    received.</p>

    <p>Modify the CPN model such that it models a Go-Back-N Window
    Protocol. In a Go-Back-N protocol, the sender sends all data
    packets in the current window and then wait for
    acknowledgements. If no acknowledgement is received (within a
    certain amount of time), the data packets in the window are all
    retransmitted. It should only be necessary to modify the Sender
    part of the CPN model.</p>

    <p>Use simulation to validate the correctness of the protocol.</p>

    <h4>Task 3: Selective Repeat Window Protocol</h4>

    <p>The Go-Back-N Window Protocol introduces the concept of a
    <i>sender window.</i> The basic idea of the Selective Repeat
    Window Protocol is that there is also a <i>receiver window</i>
    that allows the receiver to buffer packets received
    out-of-order. Furthermore, the receiver can explicitly request
    retransmission of a "missing" packet from the receiver by sending
    a <i>negative acknowledgement.</i>

    <p>Modify the CPN model such that it specifies a Selective Repeat
    Window Protocol.</p>

    <p>Use simulation to validate the correctness of the protocol.</p>
