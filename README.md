### Introduction

Coloured Petri Nets (CP-nets or CPNs) is a language for
modelling and validation of concurrent and distributed systems and
other systems in which concurrency, synchronisation, and communication
plays a major role. The CPN textbook introduces the constructs of the
CPN modelling language and explains how CPN models facilitate
simulation, state space analysis, behavioural visualisation, and
simulation-based performance analysis. It provides a comprehensive
road map to the practical use of CP-nets including a presentation of
selected industrial case studies illustrating the use of CPN modelling
and validation for design, specification, simulation, and verification
in a variety of application domains.
