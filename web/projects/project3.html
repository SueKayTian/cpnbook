    <h2>Project 3 : CPN Performance Analysis</h2>

    <p>The project is concerned with performance analysis. The goal is
    to apply simulation-based performance analysis to investigate the
    efficiency of a sliding window protocol, and compare it to the
    performance of the stop-and-wait protocol as presented in
    Chap. 12.</p>

    <p>The project consists of two tasks and relies on the support for
    performance analysis which is part of CPN Tools. As
    a preparation for the project, it is recommended that you
    familiarise yourself with the use of
    the <a href="http://wiki.daimi.au.dk/cpntools-help/performance_analysis.wiki?cmd=get&anchor=Performance+Analysis">performance
    analysis</a>
    and <a href="http://wiki.daimi.au.dk/cpntools-help/monitoring_a_cp-net.wiki?cmd=get&anchor=Monitoring+a+CP-net">monitoring</a>
    facilities of CPN Tools.

    <h4>Task 1: Stop-and-wait protocol performance</h4>

 
    <p>Start by considering
    the <a href="../models/chapter12/12-7PerformanceProtocol.cpn">CPN
    model</a> of the stop-and-wait protocol from Chap. 12.7. This CPN
    model includes the data collection monitors required in order to
    estimate the performance measures defined in Chap. 12 for the
    stop-and-wait protocol (e.g., queues, packet delay,
    throughput). </p>

    <p>Use simulation replication to investigate the performance of the
    stop-and-wait protocol in a similar way as described in
    Chap. 12. Investigate the performance of the protocol for
    different settings of the protocol parameters.</p>

    <h4>Task 2: Sliding window protocol performance</h4>

    <p>In <a href="./project1.html">project 1</a> on CPN modelling you
    developed a CPN model in task 2 (or 3) specifying a sliding window
    protocol. Integrate your solution to task 2 (or 3) from project 1
    into the
    <a href="../models/chapter12/12-7PerformanceProtocol.cpn">CPN
    model</a> of the stop-and-wait protocol from Chap
    12.7. Investigate the performance of this protocol using
    simulations in a similar way as was done in task 1 for the
    stop-and-wait protocol.</p>

    <p>Compare the results obtained in this task with the results
    obtained in task 1. Under what circumstances and in what sense is
    the sliding-window protocol more efficient that the stop-and-wait
    protocol? What parameters have the most influence on the
    performance of two protocols.</p>
